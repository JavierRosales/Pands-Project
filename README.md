## This project required me to research the well known Fisher's Iris data set, and provide my  own analysis of it. This will require me to research and provide scripts of Python code to illustrate my findings.

**1. Project Plan**

For this project my goal will be to work for eight hours a week. I aim to do this by working in four two hour sessions a week over the next four weeks to complete this. This should provide me with sufficient time to complete a very good project before the deadline. 

I will be first explaining what is involved when setting out to investigate a data set, and how you can back up arguments using scripts of code through Python and graphs which will illustrate and back up your findings.

In my research I will be providing, background information on the data set, a detailed analysis of the data set and my findings, which will be included in this ReadMe. In this I will explain how I investigated and summarized the data set, my findings and other peoples analysis's which I considered interesting. 
 
I will be using Python scripts of code to explain my arguments and findings, and attached will be graphs and snippets in the ReadMe.

Finally I will provide a summary and draw my conclusion of the data set.

**2. What's involved when investigating a data set and how Python can be used as a tool.**

When investigating data four steps to follow can be as follows;
**1. Question**
**2. Analyze**
**3. Investigate**
**4. Repeat** 

Data can be an excellent resource when trying to predict, forecast, improved decision-making or gain a competitive advantage. When investigating a data set you ask yourself what you want to get from it? What is the sole purpose of it, and will pulling data answer the problem want to solve correctly? You will need to set aside an amount of time to research the topic/sector you are investigating and understand the problem. An excellent way of aiding in your investigations by displaying results, is by writing code using Python. This will display data and explore trends weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly based on what you are looking for.

Try and picture what your data set will look like, how you are going to write the code necessary to back up your findings. It's a lot easier to spot relationships between variables if you analyze data from different subsets. What type of statistical tools you will need to get your point across, bar charts, line charts, histograms etc. What tools you can use to measure the relationship between two variables or multi-variables? Some examples to achieve this would be correlation testing, scatter plots. And for multi-variables you might use heat maps, regression, ratios etc. 




**3. What is the Fisher Iris data set?**

This Iris data set was introduced by British mathematician and statistician Ronald Fisher which he published in his paper in 1936 *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. The data set is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms. The data set contains a set of 150 records of flowers representing three species of Iris (Iris setosa, versicolor and virginica) under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species. It is a data set which is based on the combination of these four features, petal length and width, sepal length and width. Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

**4. Who was fisher?**

Sir Ronald Fisher was a British Statistician who pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments. He was born in London and studied mathematics at Cambridge University and graduated with a B.A. in astronomy. He continued to work at Cambridge after he graduated where he focused on astronomy and physics,the theory of errors. He taught maths and physics in Cambridge while he focused his research on statistics and genetics until 1919.

In 1919 he did statistical work associated with plant breeding experiments and his methods were published and remained in print for more than 50 years. The experiments that he conducted led to theories about gene dominance and fitness. He analyzed crop data and experiments since the late 1800's and developed the analysis of variance. (https://www.statisticssolutions.com/manova-analysis-anova/) In 1921 He published *Studies in Crop Variation*, which was his first application of analysis of variance.(ANOVA)

In 1933 he became head of Eugenics( beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of human population by excluding certain groups judged to be inferior and promoting certain groups judged to be superior) at University College London. While here he published *The Design of Experiments* in 1935, which he outlined *The Lady Tasting Tea* which is now a famous design of a statistical randomized experiment. 

In 1936 he introduced the *Iris Flower Data Set* as an example of discriminant analysis. This was a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. 

He worked in Cambridge from 1940 until 1956 where he published many more books and papers on data sets. In 1957 he retired to Adelaide, and he died in 1962.
