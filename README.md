# This project required me to research the well known Fisher's Iris data set, and provide my  own analysis of it. This will require me to research and provide scripts of Python code to    illustrate my findings. 

# Project Plan.
To start with I will be working on this project for six to eight hours a week over four weeks. This should provide me with sufficient time to complete a very good project before the deadline. 

I will be first explaining what is involved when setting out to investigate a data set, and how you can back up arguments using scripts of code through Python and graphs which will illustrate and back up your findings.

In my research I will be providing, background information on the data set, a detailed analysis of the data set and my findings, which will be included in this ReadMe. In this I will explain how I investigated and summarized the data set, my findings and other peoples analysis's which I considered interesting. 
 
I will be using Python scripts of code to explain my arguments and findings, and attached will be graphs and snippets in the ReadMe.

Finally I will provide a summary and draw my conclusion of the data set.
